# Docker Composer

- Makes multi-container setups easier
- It is based on a `docker-compose.yml` configuration file describing all containers, volumes, ports, networks etc.
- It works together with `Dockerfile`s for custom images
- It is best suited to organize multi containers on a **single** machine
